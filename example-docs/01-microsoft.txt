# Microsoft: The Story of a Tech Giant

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

The story of Microsoft starts with two young friends—**Bill Gates** and **Paul Allen**. Both loved computers at a time when most people had never even seen one. In the 1970s, computers were huge machines used mainly by scientists and big companies. But Gates and Allen believed that one day, everyone would have a computer at home and in the office.

In 1975, they saw an article in a magazine about a new computer called the Altair 8800. It was small (for that time) and could be bought by hobbyists. The two friends saw a big opportunity. They called the company that made the Altair and told them they had created a programming language for it, even though they hadn’t written it yet!

They worked day and night and finally made a version of the **BASIC** programming language for the Altair. It worked! The company liked it, and Microsoft was born.

### The Name "Microsoft"

The name **Microsoft** comes from “microcomputer” and “software.” It was first written as “Micro-Soft” but later became Microsoft. It officially became a company on April 4, 1975, with Bill Gates as its first CEO.

## Chapter 2: The Big Break

In 1980, Microsoft got a major opportunity that changed everything. IBM, a major computer company, wanted to create personal computers (PCs) and needed an operating system—the software that helps computers run. They asked Microsoft if they had one.

Microsoft didn’t have one at the time. But they quickly bought a small system called **QDOS** (Quick and Dirty Operating System), improved it, and renamed it **MS-DOS**. IBM used it in their computers, and soon, MS-DOS became the most used operating system in the world.

This deal made Microsoft very rich and famous. MS-DOS was used by millions of people and helped personal computers become more common.

## Chapter 3: Windows Changes Everything

MS-DOS worked with typed commands, but Microsoft wanted to make computers easier for everyone. So, in 1985, they launched **Windows 1.0**, a new type of operating system with a graphical user interface (GUI). Instead of typing, people could now use a mouse to click on icons and windows.

Windows didn’t become popular right away. But Microsoft kept improving it. With **Windows 3.0** in 1990 and **Windows 95** in 1995, they finally hit the jackpot. Windows 95 was a game-changer. It was easy to use and came with features like the Start menu and taskbar that we still use today.

Windows became the standard for PCs, and Microsoft became the biggest software company in the world.

## Chapter 4: Microsoft Office

As computers became more common in businesses and homes, people needed software to do tasks like writing documents, creating spreadsheets, and making presentations. Microsoft launched **Microsoft Office** in 1989.

It included:

* **Word** (for writing),
* **Excel** (for spreadsheets),
* **PowerPoint** (for presentations), and
* **Outlook** (for emails).

Microsoft Office became a must-have for offices and schools. Millions of people around the world started using it daily.

## Chapter 5: The Internet and Competition

In the mid-1990s, the internet started to become popular. Microsoft launched **Internet Explorer** to compete with Netscape, the most used web browser at the time. Microsoft included Internet Explorer for free with Windows, which helped it quickly become the number-one browser.

However, Microsoft faced criticism. People said they were using their power unfairly to crush smaller companies. In 1998, the U.S. government sued Microsoft for being a monopoly. The case went on for years and ended with a settlement.

Despite this, Microsoft kept growing and making new products. They entered the gaming world, business software, and cloud computing.

## Chapter 6: Xbox and the Gaming World

In 2001, Microsoft launched the **Xbox**, a video game console to compete with Sony’s PlayStation and Nintendo. It was a bold move, but it worked. Xbox became popular, especially among younger audiences.

They followed it with **Xbox 360**, **Xbox One**, and **Xbox Series X/S**. Alongside the consoles, Microsoft built a strong game network with **Xbox Live**, allowing people to play online with friends around the world.

In 2014, Microsoft bought **Mojang**, the company behind the hit game **Minecraft**, which became one of the best-selling games ever.

In 2020s, Microsoft bought **ZeniMax Media** (makers of games like Doom and Fallout) and **Activision Blizzard**, one of the largest game companies, known for Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and World of Warcraft. This made Microsoft one of the biggest gaming companies on the planet.

## Chapter 7: New Leaders, New Vision

In 2000, Bill Gates stepped down as CEO and handed the role to **Steve Ballmer**, a longtime friend and Microsoft leader. Ballmer led the company through the 2000s, focusing on business software.

However, Microsoft struggled in some areas, especially in mobile phones. Their **Windows Phone** couldn’t compete with Apple’s iPhone or Google’s Android.

In 2014, **Satya Nadella** became the CEO. He brought a fresh vision. Nadella focused on:

* **Cloud computing** with **Azure**
* Working with other companies instead of fighting them
* AI (artificial intelligence)
* Growing services like Office 365, Teams, and LinkedIn (which Microsoft bought in 2016)

Under his leadership, Microsoft became more modern and flexible.

## Chapter 8: The Cloud and Azure

One of Microsoft’s biggest achievements in recent years is **Azure**, its cloud platform. It allows companies to store data, run apps, and manage services online instead of using local servers.

Azure competes directly with Amazon Web Services (AWS), and it is used by businesses, governments, and developers worldwide.

Microsoft also turned **Office** into **Office 365**, a cloud-based subscription. People can use Word, Excel, and other apps from any device, and everything is stored in the cloud.

They also created **Microsoft Teams**, which became very popular during the COVID-19 pandemic as people worked and studied from home.

## Chapter 9: Artificial Intelligence and Copilot

In recent years, Microsoft has become a major player in **AI**. They partnered with **OpenAI**, the company behind **ChatGPT**, and brought AI features into products like Word, Excel, and Outlook.

They called this AI feature **Copilot**—a smart assistant that helps users write, summarize, code, or find information faster.

Microsoft is also using AI to improve **Bing**, its search engine, and challenge Google.

## Chapter 10: Achievements and Legacy

Here are some major achievements of Microsoft:

* **World’s Leading Software Company**: Microsoft Windows and Office are used by billions of people worldwide.
* **Trillion-Dollar Company**: In 2019, Microsoft became a \$1 trillion company. As of 2025, it is one of the most valuable companies in the world.
* **Diversity and Inclusion**: Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has worked to become more inclusive and diverse.
* **Environmental Goals**: Microsoft has pledged to become carbon negative by 2030—meaning it will remove more carbon than it emits.
* **Philanthropy**: Bill Gates stepped down from Microsoft to focus on the **Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation**, one of the largest charitable organizations in the world.

## Chapter 11: Fun Facts About Microsoft

* The company started in **Albuquerque, New Mexico**, not in Silicon Valley or Seattle.
* The famous **"Clippy"**, the animated paperclip, was part of Microsoft Office in the 90s and early 2000s.
* Microsoft’s headquarters is in **Redmond, Washington**.
* Microsoft employees are sometimes called "**Softies**."
* The company gives away a lot of money in grants and donations each year.

## Chapter 12: Looking Ahead

Microsoft continues to grow and evolve. With AI, cloud, gaming, and business tools, it is shaping the future of how we live and work.

Whether it's helping students write papers, helping businesses manage data, or helping gamers enjoy new worlds, Microsoft touches the lives of billions every day.

From a small startup in 1975 to a global tech leader in 2025, Microsoft’s journey is a powerful reminder that big dreams, hard work, and vision can truly change the world.
